    => Began working on DungeonGenerator.c

2/8/2021
    => Rendered a dummy dungeon in the console.
    => Realized that I cant just use a 2d array of chars and I have to use an array of objects/cells. Looks like that will be a tomorrow progect.
2/9/2021
    =>tried to change the array of char to an array of structs. I can't figure it out. I will just deal with it next week when I have to.
